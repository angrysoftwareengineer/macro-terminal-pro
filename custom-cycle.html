          CNC Macro Simulator II was to be available from the very beginning on many platforms, such as Windows, MacOS,
          Linux, Android and IOS.
          Therefore, it is distributed as PWA by default.
          Although in this form, the software takes up much less space on the computer's disk, having practically the
          same advantages as any other native software.
          Unfortunately, that also has a downside: Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge is required to install CNC Macro
          Simulator II.

            <strong>easy to create</strong> - custom cycles are created in virtually the same way as typical
            subroutines in the Fanuc Macro B or Centroid standard. The difference is that they can have a detailed
            description of the arguments, which allows a large part of the program to be generated automatically
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>universality</strong> - custom cycles can be used both in a typical macro program or in
            conversational programming (via the user interface)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>simplicity of use and testing</strong> - custom cycles are automatically embedded in the main
            program with one
            click, along with their invocation and assignment of addresses to the corresponding variables. Moreover, no
            matter whether you use variables in the range #1 to #26 or #1 to #33, the appropriate addresses will be
            automatically assigned
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>less code to write</strong> - thanks to the detailed description of arguments, such as default
            value, test for
            values used by the user or description, a large amount of repetitive and necessary code can be generated
            automatically
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>easier to maintain code</strong> - when using custom cycles, information such as their name or
            argument
            description is written separately, thanks to which the main code responsible for executing a specific
            function is much smaller and more readable
          </li>
