          CNC Macro Simulator was to be available from the very beginning on many platforms, such as Windows, MacOS,
          Linux, Android and IOS.
          Therefore, it is distributed as PWA by default.
          Although in this form, the software takes up much less space on the computer's disk, having practically the
          same advantages as any other native software.
          Unfortunately, that also has a downside: Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge is required to install CNC Macro
          Simulator.

          However, if you prefer a standard file (e.g. .exe for Windows or .app for Mac or other), please inform about
          it in advance in the transaction description. Just remember that it takes up a lot more memory on your
          computer and it takes 1-2 days (from the moment the payment is received).
