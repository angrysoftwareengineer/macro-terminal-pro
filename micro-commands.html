            Manual programming can seems like a waste of time these days, especially when compared to CAD/CAM or conversational software. Unfortunately, the two mentioned above are also not without their drawbacks. CAD/CAM software is often complicated to use and requires time to learn, and often its complexity and price are not commensurate with the typical tasks that many workshops perform. The problem may also be the lack of toolpath control. Conversation software, while easier to use, in many cases has a limited number of functions which prevents it from being used in unusual, sudden applications.
