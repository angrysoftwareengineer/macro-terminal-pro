            In this case, we will use one of the built-in code examples.

          <img class="article__img" src="resources/code-error.png" alt="code error"/>
          <p class="article__content">In the screenshot above, you can see what happens after the code is executed. As you can see, a lot of bugs have emerged. This is due to the fact that the example program used does not have such information about the tool used and other important information, without which the tool can hit the milling table or the workpiece.
            But if you are writing code only for learning macros or writing a subroutine and therefore your code does not contain information such as the tool number or other information that is usually entered at the beginning of the main program, you can disable AVS by using the switch in the settings (see image below).
