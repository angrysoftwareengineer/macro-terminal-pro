          ("Software") provided by <strong>PJ Software</strong> ("we", "our", or "us"). By purchasing, downloading,
          installing, or using the Software, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms,

          or guardian consent to use the Software. You also affirm that you have the legal authority to agree to these
          Terms on behalf of any entity you represent.</p>

        <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
        <p>Upon your one-time payment, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual license to
          install and use the Software on a specified number of devices (as determined by the license type purchased)
          for personal or internal business purposes. This license is subject to the following restrictions:</p>

        <h3>a. Restrictions on Use</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You may not reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or modify the Software, except as explicitly allowed
            by law.</li>
          <li>You may not rent, lease, sublicense, sell, distribute, or transfer the Software to a third party.</li>
          <li>You may not use the Software in any unlawful manner or for any unlawful purpose.</li>
          <li>You may not remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices (e.g., copyright, trademark) within the
            Software.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. License Types</h3>
        <p>The specific type of license (e.g., single-user license, multi-user license, enterprise license) and the
          number of devices on which you may install the Software are detailed during the purchase process. Unauthorized
          use outside the scope of the purchased license is prohibited and may result in license termination.</p>

        <h2>3. Payment and Delivery</h2>

        <h3>a. Payment</h3>
        <p>By purchasing the Software, you agree to pay the one-time fee specified at the time of purchase. The fee is

        <h2>4. Refunds and Cancellations</h2>

        <h3>a. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>Due to the nature of digital products, we generally do not offer refunds after the Software has been
          delivered. However, refunds may be considered on a case-by-case basis, such as if the Software is found to be
          defective or significantly different from its description.</p>

        <h3>b. Refund Request</h3>
        <p>If you believe you are entitled to a refund, you must contact us within 30 days of purchase at
          macrosimulatorcnc@gmail.com, providing your order number and a detailed explanation of the issue. We reserve
          the right to

          your settings. These updates are included in the one-time purchase unless specified otherwise.</p>
